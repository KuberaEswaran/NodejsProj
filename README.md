# Node3 Project

Welcome to the **Node3** project! This project is designed to help you learn and build applications using Node.js. Below are some steps to get started and improve your skills.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Node.js**  
    Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Initialize the Project**  
    Run the following command to initialize your project:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
    Add any required dependencies using:
    ```bash
    npm install <package-name>
    ```

4. **Create Your Application**  
    Start by creating an `index.js` file and writing your first Node.js script:
    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello, Node3!");
    ```

## Learning Resources

- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [FreeCodeCamp Node.js Tutorials](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## Next Steps

- Build a simple HTTP server using the `http` module.
- Explore popular frameworks like Express.js.
- Learn about asynchronous programming and promises.  
    Asynchronous programming is a key concept in Node.js. Start by understanding callbacks, then move on to promises and async/await. Check out the [MDN guide on Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) for more details.

Happy coding!
